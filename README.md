# Project M.U.L.T.I.P.A.S.S.

This is a simple SPA to be used as a personal links portal (as an analogous replacement for simply using browser-based links & folders).

The intent of this project is to gain familiarity with the Angular framework & related technologies (Typescript, CSS/SCSS, etc).

# To-Dos (in no particular order):

* Establish a cloud-based back-end data store for the links, their data & a simple user list (for access control & CRUD operations of categories, links and users).
* Create a CRUD operations UI for managing categories, links and users.
* Make the UI dynamic so that there can be different types of category representations (not just link panels).
* Authentication/Authorization support.
